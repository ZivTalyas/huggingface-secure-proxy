## ü§î Why This App?

In today's AI-driven world, protecting your applications from harmful, malicious, or inappropriate content is critical. This proxy acts as a security gateway that:

- **Prevents Injection Attacks**: Filters SQL injection, XSS, and other code injection attempts
- **Blocks Harmful Content**: Identifies toxic language, hate speech, and inappropriate material
- **Validates File Uploads**: Safely processes PDF and text files before they reach your models
- **Ensures Compliance**: Helps maintain content standards for user-facing AI applications
- **Protects Model Performance**: Prevents adversarial inputs that could compromise ML model behavior

Perfect for chatbots, content moderation systems, document processing pipelines, and any application that processes user-generated content.

   - **Text Input**: Type or paste text directly into the textarea
   - **File Upload**: Click "Attach File" to upload PDF or TXT files

3. **Select Security Level**:
   - **High**: Maximum protection (rule-based + ML analysis + deep file inspection)
   - **Medium**: Balanced performance and security
   - **Low**: Basic rule-based validation only

4. **Validate**: Click the "Validate" button to analyze your input

5. **Review Results**: Get detailed feedback including:
   - Safety status (Safe/Unsafe/Error)
   - Confidence scores
   - Detected issues
   - Analysis summary

### API Usage

#### Validate Text
```bash
curl -X POST https://safe-input-proxy-frontend.onrender.com/validate-input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello, this is a test message",
    "security_level": "high"
  }'
```

#### Validate File (Base64 encoded)
```bash
curl -X POST https://safe-input-proxy-frontend.onrender.com/validate-input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file": "base64-encoded-file-content",
    "security_level": "high"
  }'
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "safe",
  "reason": "safe",
  "llm_score": 0.85,
  "rule_score": 0.92,
  "overall_score": 0.88,
  "detected_issues": [],
  "analysis_summary": "Content passed all security checks",
  "processing_time_ms": 45.2
}
```

## ‚ö° Technical Choices & Architecture

### Framework & Language Stack
- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework for both frontend and backend APIs
  - Automatic API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
  - High performance with async/await support
  - Built-in data validation with Pydantic models
  - Excellent for microservices architecture

- **Python 3.8+**: Primary development language
  - Rich ecosystem for security and ML libraries
  - Easy integration with C++ modules
  - Strong community support

### Performance & Core Processing
- **C++ Security Analyzer**: Performance-critical security analysis

  - **Backend Service** (Port 8001): Heavy security analysis, ML processing
  - **Redis**: Caching layer and potential rate limiting
  
- **Benefits**:
  - Crash isolation (frontend stays up if backend fails)
  - Independent scaling of services
  - Easier maintenance and deployment

### Containerization & Deployment

  - **Pattern Matching**: SQL injection, XSS, code injection detection
  - **File Analysis**: Safe PDF and text file processing
  - **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable security levels

- **Security Features**:
  - Input sanitization and validation
  - File type verification
  - Size limits (10MB max)
  - Base64 encoding for safe file transfer
  - Temporary file handling with cleanup

### Data & Caching
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store
  - Response caching for improved performance
  - Session management capabilities
  - Rate limiting implementation ready
  - Pub/sub for service communication

### Development Tools
- **Environment Management**: `.env` files for configuration
- **Health Checks**: Built-in service monitoring
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging across services
- **Hot Reloading**: Development-friendly auto-restart

### Why These Choices?

1. **FastAPI**: Chosen for its modern async capabilities, automatic documentation, and excellent performance
2. **Microservices**: Allows independent scaling and better fault tolerance
3. **C++**: Critical for performance in security analysis - significantly faster than pure Python
