SecurePipe: Real-Time LLM Gateway with AI-
Powered Security Filtering
Overview
SecurePipe is a modular, real-time gateway service that inspects and processes data sent to large language
models (LLMs), ensuring security, compliance, and safe usage of generative AI systems. It provides traffic
filtering, sandboxing, AI-based content analysis, and intelligent forwarding to external LLMs such as OpenAI
or Anthropic.


This service is designed to simulate a production-grade environment with strong emphasis on:


     â€¢ Security and data integrity
     â€¢ AI-enhanced policy enforcement
     â€¢ CI/CD and team-oriented development practices
     â€¢ Hybrid development using C++, Python, and Docker

SecurePipe is ideal for organizations looking to deploy or gate access to LLMs in a secure, auditable, and
controlled fashion.




Key Features
     â€¢ Secure Input Inspection: Text and file inputs are pre-validated using C++ for speed and safety.
     â€¢ AI Content Filtering: Python-based service classifies content using LLMs and heuristics.
     â€¢ File Sandbox Execution: Suspicious files are executed in Docker sandbox environments and
       analyzed.
     â€¢ Forwarding Gateway: Approved content is forwarded automatically to external LLMs.
     â€¢ Audit Logging: Full traceability of input, analysis, and output decisions.
     â€¢ CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions pipeline for testing, building, and security checks.

Technologies Used

      Tool                         Purpose

      C++                          High-performance pre-validation of requests

      Python                       Business logic, AI integration, and sandbox control

      FastAPI                      API server and WebSocket support

      Docker                       Containerized microservices and sandboxing

      ClamAV                       Optional AV scan on uploaded files

      OpenAI API / LLaMA.cpp       AI classification engine

      GitHub Actions               Continuous Integration and automated testing

      Docker Compose               Multi-service orchestration for local and production deployment




API Workflow
   1. Client Submits Request
   2. Via REST or WebSocket




                                                    2
   3. Payload includes input type (text or file), user ID, and LLM target
   4. Gateway Pre-Checks
   5. Validate size, structure, format
   6. Calculate hash and compare with cache
   7. AI Analysis
   8. Text: sent to classification model (e.g., OpenAI/GPT-4)
   9. File: basic metadata inspection
  10. Optional Sandbox
  11. File executed in Docker container with resource limits
  12. Observes behavior (file writes, network access)
  13. Verdict Engine
  14. If safe â†’ forward to LLM
  15. If flagged â†’ respond with reason
  16. Forwarding & Response
  17. Forwarded to selected LLM (proxy)
  18. Return answer to client




Security Considerations
    â€¢ Input validation and strict file type enforcement
    â€¢ Isolation via Docker containers for sandboxing
    â€¢ Encrypted API traffic (HTTPS, JWT optional)
    â€¢ Access control policies for users
    â€¢ Full audit logs for post-mortem analysis




Deployment
    â€¢ Docker Compose for full environment (gateway, AI, sandbox, Redis, database)
    â€¢ Environment variables for model keys, sandbox limits, etc.
    â€¢ CI/CD auto-deploys to staging/dev via GitHub Actions
